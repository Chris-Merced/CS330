### How do I approach designing software?
I approach designing software by focusing on modularity and reusability. Breaking the project into smaller, manageable components ensures the code is organized, maintainable, and scalable.

### What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
This project helped me refine my ability to design reusable functions and plan the structure of code for clarity and scalability. I also improved in identifying patterns that simplify future updates or enhancements.

### What design process did you follow for your project work?
I followed a process that began with understanding the requirements, creating a high-level plan, and implementing small, testable components. Iteration and IDE feedback guided me in refining the design to meet project goals effectively.

### How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
Tactics like modular design, iterative refinement, and clear documentation can be applied to future projects to ensure flexibility and reduce development time. These strategies also help maintain consistency across different parts of a project.

### How do I approach developing programs?
I focus on writing clean, modular code and using iterative development to build and refine features. Testing frequently helps me identify and address issues early in the process.

### What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
I incorporated reusable rendering functions and explored libraries that simplified complex computational graphics. 

### How did iteration factor into your development?
Iteration was central to my development, allowing me to test new features, address bugs, and refine the project step by step. This ensured steady progress and a polished final product.

### How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project’s completion?
My approach evolved from focusing on individual tasks to planning holistically and prioritizing reusability. I now approach problems with a clearer structure and a stronger emphasis on testing and refinement.

### How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Computer science equips me with problem-solving skills and the tools to create innovative solutions. It provides the foundation to achieve my goals in building efficient, user-focused applications.

### How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
They’ve taught me about algorithms, mathematical transformations, and performance optimization, which are crucial in fields like simulations and data analysis. These skills strengthen my understanding of computational logic and visual representation.

### How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
These skills prepare me for careers in areas like game development, simulation, and data visualization by enabling me to create interactive and informative visual experiences. They also enhance my ability to communicate complex data effectively.
